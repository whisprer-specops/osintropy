A complete guide for uncovering actionable insights on any email address.

Image source: Author’s screenshot. This figure illustrates how Email OSINT can uncover digital footprints.
In this article, I will demonstrate various web-based tools and Telegram bots that identify digital footprints linked to an email address.
Each tool has been thoroughly tested for potential outcomes. Tools URLs, along with their interfaces, features and results, are provided in each section.
Here’s what you can discover about an email:
• Associated phone numbers
• Profile URLs on platforms like X(Twitter), Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn, Skype, Flickr, and more
• Names of social media platforms and websites linked to the email
• Ownership rights to any domain or website
• Owner’s name and address
• Profile pictures
• Google reviews associated with the email account
• Involvement in scam activities
• Breached data, such as passwords, IP addresses, and other linked emails.
Requirements
Some of the tools require sign-up using an email address (such as Gmail or Yahoo), but none require a business email.
For privacy reasons, it’s recommended to create a FAKE email account for using these services and avoid using your personal email.
For insights on operational security (OPSEC), ethics, and privacy during OSINT investigations, feel free to check out my previous articles here and here.

Until now, we have investigated full email addresses (e.g., example327@yahoo.com). However, the email username (example327) plays a crucial role in uncovering additional digital presence.
